'''
This is a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result
as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place.
Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:
x is an integer
y is +, -, *, or /
z is an integer

expression = input("Expression: ")
x, y, z = expression.split(" ")
x = int(x)
z = int(z)
